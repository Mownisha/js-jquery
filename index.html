      <h1><strong> NOTES ON JAVASCRIPT AND JQUERY</strong></h1>

      <div class="js-hide">
        <p><span class="click"> JAVASCRIPT </span></p>
      </div>

        <p>Back in 1995, a developer at Netscape named Brendan Eich introduced JavaScript to the world. Despite Java and JavaScript both containing "Java" in their names, they're two distinct languages that have nothing to do with one another. The official name of JavaScript is ECMAScript which gets its name from the international organization that maintains it, ECMA (European Computer Manufacturer's Association).

JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive. Like HTML and CSS, you do not need to install anything to begin writing JavaScript or see it run on your users' computers. All modern browsers support JavaScript which means JavaScript that you write for your web pages will automatically run when your visitors load your web page in their browsers. In fact, JavaScript is the only scripting language that all browsers support so if you want a page to have dynamic content, learning JavaScript is a must.</p>

      <div class="jq-hide">
        <p><span class="click1"> JQUERY </span></p>
      </div>

      <div class="jq-show">
        <p><span class="click1"> JQUERY </span></p>
        <p>jQuery is a JavaScript library that makes it easier to incorporate JavaScript on your web pages. When we say it is a library, we mean that many common tasks that would take many, many lines of JavaScript code to execute have been packaged into methods that you'll be able to use with a single line of code. These methods are always available and ready to use the same way you might check out a book at a library. The goal of jQuery is to allow its users to "write less, do more". It's also one of the primary ways we can add interactivity to our sites.</p>

      <div class="ope-hide">
        <p><span class="click2"> OPERATORS </span></p>
      </div>

      <div class="ope-show">
        <p><span class="click2"> OPERATORS </span></p>
        <p>The = is called an assignment operator because it assigns the value on the right of the operator to the variable on the left.There is an assignment operator for each of the mathematical functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. They are +=, -=, *=, /=.Assignment operators change the value of the variable on the left of the operator. Comparison operators do not change any values, but return true or false depending on whether the statement evaluates as true or false.=== means "equal-to".!== means "not-equal-to".> means "greater-than (and not equal to)".>= is the same as >, except it evaluates to true if the two sides are equal.< is the opposite of >. It means "less-than (and not equal to)".<= is the opposite of >=. It means "less-than-or-equal-to". </p>

      <div class="var-hide">

      </div>

      <div class="var-show">
        <p><span class="click3"> VARIABLES </span></p>
        <p>Variables should begin with a letter.Variables are case sensitive (myNumber is a different variable than myNUMBER).Use clear names that describe the value being stored like myNumber.Always name your variables in a manner that will be easy for other developers to understand. Avoid vague letters or initials. (For example: var x = 45 doesn't tell us what the value is. Is 45 an age, a distance, size, a time?...)</p>

        <p>alert() is a function. A function is something that performs an action. Just like a method, a function can take an argument. The alert() function pops up a dialog box with the string that you pass in as an argument.prompt() function accepts strings as arguments and returns that strings to the console. Another built-in function that allows us to interact with the webpage user is the confirm() function. This too takes a string as an argument.</p>
